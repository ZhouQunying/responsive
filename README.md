# Responsive
  This is a responsive simple page, and the important thing is it compatible with IE8. (Will, it's my first responsive project, and I loved to develop it, by the way, page of UI is not my idea, I just re-implement it.)<br>
  If you don't what to throw it to your apache server directory, just see app directory, there are what you want. Enjoy
